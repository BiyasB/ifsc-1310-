    <h2 style="color:rgb(24, 144, 223);">Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2> <!---Edit h2 and p-->>
    <p>For the Dragon Project, my main source of feedback was my family members and they mostly commented on stylistic improvements that I could make to add a more aesthetically pleasing effect. Ideas for improvements I received included organizing the FAQ page, increasing line spacing in the paragraphs, adding a background image, and changing the text color. Out of these ideas, I decided to organize the FAQ page by including a dropdown menu function which made the webpage look more professional. I also increased the line height for all my paragraphs to allow more legibility. I rejected the idea of adding a background image and changing the text color as those ideas did not fit within the color scheme I had in mind and it would also make the website look less professional which was against the Space X guidelines. </p>
    <p>After addressing the feedback,  I also decided to add the picture slideshow to the project but on a separate webpage within the website, as I deemed the content unsuitable for the already established web pages. I made this decision because the slideshow consisted of pictures of galaxies which was in line with the theme of space but since the website is mainly an introduction to Space Xâ€™s Dragon product, the slideshow seemed like a good addition to a separate webpage rather than an addition to an already existing webpage. 
    </p>
    <p>Finally, working on this project was a great learning experience since it gave me an opportunity to work with the code and understand how it applies to the webpage. Throughout this project I found myself trying various different techniques to improve my design and this gave me a better understanding of the code. I was hesitant at times to change the code, due to the fear that I may cause a greater issue while working on fixing a small one but I did my best to overcome the anxiety and test out different techniques to better my code. </p>
    
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(13, 205, 157);">Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </h2>
    <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-progressive-enhancement#:~:text=Progressive%20enhancement%20is%20a%20fundamental,to%20new%20features%20and%20functions.">Link to Related Article 1</a>
    
    <p>In today's digital world, web development is an essential part of almost every business, organization, and individual. The web has become a primary platform for communication, commerce, entertainment, and education, and it is constantly evolving to meet the needs of users. One of the most important concepts in modern web development is progressive enhancement, which refers to the approach of building web applications that work for everyone, regardless of their device, browser, or internet connection.
    </p>
    
    <p>Progressive enhancement involves building websites in layers, starting with a basic HTML and CSS foundation and then adding more advanced features and functionality as needed. This approach ensures the website's core content and functionality are available to all users, even those with older browsers or slower internet connections. By focusing on the core content and functionality of a website, developers can create a more accessible and user-friendly experience for all users, regardless of their technical capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>The importance of progressive enhancement in modern web development cannot be overstated. Here are some of the key reasons why:
    </p>

    <p>Accessibility: Progressive enhancement ensures that web applications are accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities, users with low-end devices, and users with slow internet connections. 
    </p>

    <p>Inclusivity: Progressive enhancement promotes inclusivity by ensuring that web applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their background, culture, or language.</p>

    <p>Usability: Progressive enhancement improves usability by ensuring that web applications are fast, reliable, and easy to use. </p>

    <p>Future-proofing: Progressive enhancement future-proofs web applications by ensuring that they are flexible and adaptable to technological changes.
    </p>

    <p>SEO: Progressive enhancement improves search engine optimization (SEO) by ensuring that web applications are accessible and usable by search engine crawlers.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that emphasizes accessibility, inclusivity, and usability. By starting with an essential, functional website and then adding more advanced features and capabilities, developers can ensure that their applications are accessible, inclusive, usable, future-proof, and optimized for search engines. And so as the web continues to evolve, progressive enhancement will become increasingly important in ensuring that web applications work for everyone, thus creating a more inclusive web experience, where all users can access and interact with websites on an equal footing.</p>
