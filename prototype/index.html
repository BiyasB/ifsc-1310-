      <p>Ramsay's television appearances are defined by his bluntness, fiery temper, strict demeanour, and frequent use of <strong> profanity.</strong>He combines activities in the television, film, hospitality, and food industries, and has promoted and hired various chefs who have apprenticed under his wing. He is known for presenting television programmes about competitive cookery and food, such as the British series <em> Hell's Kitchen (2004), Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares (2004–2009, 2014), and The F Word (2005–2010), with Kitchen Nightmares winning the 2005 British Academy Television Award for Best Feature, and the American versions of Hell's Kitchen (2005–present), Kitchen Nightmares (2007–2014), MasterChef (2010–present), and MasterChef Junior (2013–present), as well as Hotel Hell (2012–2016), Gordon Behind Bars (2012), Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back (2018–2020), and Next Level Chef (2022–present).</em> </p>
      <p>Ramsay was appointed an OBE by <strong> Queen Elizabeth II </strong> in the <strong> 2006 New Year Honours </strong> list for services to the hospitality industry. He was named the top chef in the UK at the 2000 <strong> Catey Awards</strong>, and in July 2006 he won the Catey for Independent Restaurateur of the Year, becoming only the third person to have won three Catey Awards. In 2020, <em> Forbes</em> listed his earnings at US $70 million for the previous 12 months and ranked him at No. 19 on <strong> its list of the highest-earning celebrities.</strong></p>
